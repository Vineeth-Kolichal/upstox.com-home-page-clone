                    <h2>What is a Demat account?</h2>

                    <h3> Demat account is an acronym for Dematerialized accounts.</h3>

                    <p>As you need to have a bank account to deposit your money and earn interest, in the same way, you
                        need to open a Demat account to buy or sell financial securities such as stocks and Equity
                        Traded Funds(ETFs). Demat account is necessary to hold securities electronically.</p>

                    <p>When you buy stocks or shares, they will get credited to your account. When you sell the stocks
                        or shares you have purchased, they will get debited from your account.</p>

                    <p>By opening the Demat account, you do not need to transfer your share certificates physically to
                        the buyer. You need to link your bank account with your Demat account, through which you can
                        easily buy and sell shares. It does not only save your time, but it also reduces the transaction
                        cost.</p>

                    <p>It is now mandatory to have a Demat Account to buy or sell securities that are listed on the
                        exchanges, such as stocks of companies. However, you don’t need a Demat Account to invest in
                        mutual funds, insurance schemes and other traditional saving options.</p>

                    <p> While opening up a Demat account, you will have to bear some charges to maintain your account,
                        such as Demat account opening charges, safety charges or custodian fees, annual maintenance
                        charges, transaction charges, etc.</p>

                    <p> You can easily open an Upstox Demat account online without any Demat account opening charges or
                        account maintenance charges.</p>

                    <p>The Demat account is more than just a depository for investors' securities. It is a move to bring
                        transparency and regulation to the securities markets.</p>

                    <p>The National Stock Market of India was the country's first completely automated stock exchange
                        that made the Demat account India mandatory. It officially opened in 1994, and share trading in
                        Demat form began in 1996. Currently, a Demat account in India is compulsory to invest and trade
                        in equities and other asset classes. As a result, there is no need to keep physical share
                        certificates anymore.</p>

                            trading, futures and options.</li>
